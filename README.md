Fetchdogs is an ongoing experiment in learning how to build beautiful, intuitive [React / Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) components using [Material UI](https://mui.com/), [React Beautiful DND](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

Shoutouts to [@ehwhydubya](https://github.com/ehwhydubya)... I still think Fetchcats was better. 😸
